# Knowns Team

> *Good tools do not need to be complex, they just need to solve the right problem.*

We are a small open-source team from Vietnam, building developer tools that actually matter.

## Who We Are

Knowns is a team of 4 developers with a simple mission: **reduce complexity, increase productivity**.

We believe great tools don't need to be complicated — they just need to solve the right problem.

## Our Product

### Knowns CLI

A CLI-first knowledge management tool that helps developers:

- **Task Management** — Manage work directly from your terminal
- **Time Tracking** — Track time spent on tasks
- **Documentation** — Organize project documentation
- **AI-Ready Workflow** — Structure knowledge so AI can work as a real teammate

```bash
# Install
npm install -g knowns

# Initialize project
knowns init

# Create task
knowns task create "Build new feature" --ac "Tests pass" --ac "Docs updated"

# Start working
knowns task edit 1 -s in-progress
knowns time start 1
```

**Core concept**: *"If knowledge is explicit, structured, and versioned, AI can work like a real teammate."*
